TASK-1: Chatbot Development :This project implements a chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user input based on intents. The chatbot is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression algorithm to identify intents and extract entities from user input. The chatbot interface is developed using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications.

#Features
Intent Detection: The chatbot can identify the purpose behind user input (e.g., greeting, asking for information).
Entity Extraction: Extracts relevant data from user input (e.g., questions, names).
Interactive Chat Interface: The chatbot interface allows users to communicate directly with the chatbot through a web application built with Streamlit.
